        "- list use \" [] \" brackets while list use \" () \" brackets\n",
        "- list uses more memory spaces than tuple\n",
        "- tuple is faster than list\n",

        "4.)  Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        "- In python dictionary store data in the form of key and value pairs\n",
        "-  where keys are immutable and unique\n",
        "-  while vlues are mutable and can be repeated\n",

        "- A hash table is a data structure that stores kry value pairs and provide fast acces to data through use of hash function which compute an index in an underlying array, where each value get stored\n",
        "- Hash table is related to dictionaries in python in a way that\n",
        "  * when you store something in dictionaries, python uses hash function to decide where to place it.\n",
        "  * when you look up a key, python uses again a hash function to direct accessing to the value\n",

        "- Dictionaries provide several key benefits over list for certain task especially when you need fast lookup\n",

        "  * Fast lookup: dictionaries can find values quickly using keys with almost no delay, while lists have to check items one by one\n",
        "  * Key-Value-Pair storage: Dictionaries store data in the form of key value whick make it faster and easier for modification while list not\n",
        "  * Avoid duplication: Dictionary store data in the form of keys and values in which keys are unique which avoid duplication in dictionaries, while list allow duplicates value.\n",
        "  * Flexible Access: You don't have to remember the position (index) of an item, just its key, which makes accessing data more efficiently.\n",
        "  * Better for Large Data: Dictionaries handle large amounts of data more efficiently especially when you need to frequently search, add, or delete items based on keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.) Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "- A scenario where tuple is preferable over a list when you have a coolection of item that should not be changed throughout the program.\n",
        "- Example: If you have to store a data that can not be chaned like co-ordinates of a point (X,Y) , or set of constant configuration value, a tuple is ideal because it is immutable and cannot be accidentally modified, this provides safety and ensures data integrity.\n",

        "13.) How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "- In python, set ignore duplicate values if you enter a element that was already present in a set it won't be added again\n",
        "- When you add items to a set, python keeps only one copy of each unique value because sets are based on hash tables and can only store unique elements.\n",
        "- It means that\n",
        "  * It ignores duplicates\n",
        "  * only unique value remains\n",
        "  * order is not guranteed (set is unordered)\n",

        "- \"in\" keyword work diffrently in list and dictionaries\n",
        "    ##### LIST\n",
        "    * For list, \"in\" keyword is used to check if the value is present in the list by scanning each elements in the list, It returns True if the value is present or gives False when value is not present.\n",

        "    *     lis = [10, 20, 30]\n",

        "    * To check for the presence of a value in a dictionary, you need to explicitly use the .values()\n",
        "    * To check for the presence of a key-value pair, you can use the .items() method\n",
        "    * ex:\n",
        "    *     person = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
        "    *     print(\"name\" in person)  # True\n",

        "- Accessing elements in a Python dictionary has an average time complexity of O(1), meaning the retrieval time is constant regardless of the dictionary's size\n",

        "#### Worst Case: O(n)\n",

Examples include a list of numbers, names, or objects of the same type.\n",
